# Order-menu

This app was built using Vue.js, Vue Router (v4), Vuex (v4) and the CSS preprocessor Sass (SCSS).

It allowed me to learn Vuex.

## What this app can do

- Add or remove quantity of a specific product inside its own page.
- Remove quantity for a specific product inside the order resume component.
- The order resume component lists all the added products.
- The order resume component shows and update the price based on the added products.
